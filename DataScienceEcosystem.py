# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[3]:


(3*4)+5
# this a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers


# In[9]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60

rounded_hours = round(hours, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places
print(f"{rounded_hours} hours")
